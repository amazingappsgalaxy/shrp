Model name: Smart Upscaler

Workflow nodes:
#230 Input Image (image) — LoadImage
#213 Scale By (scale_by) — ImageScaleBy
#214 Width (width) — ImageResize+
#214 Height (height) — ImageResize+
#215 Output — SaveImage

Resolution settings:
  4K: scale_by = 2, width = 4096, height = 4096  →  80 credits
  8K: scale_by = 4, width = 8192, height = 8192  → 120 credits

Task timer (approximate backend duration for loading animation only):
  190 seconds (both 4K and 8K)
Note: task timer is used only to calibrate the loading progress animation speed.
      If the backend responds earlier the task is immediately marked complete.
